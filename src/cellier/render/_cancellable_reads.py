"""Cancellable one-off reads: the pick-value reader.

``plans/scheduler_only_loading_design_v2.md`` 4.10 (D8).  Every visual loads
through the chunk scheduler, which never cancels; the only reads left that a
caller cancels are the pick-value reads of a non-memory store (a pointer
moved on before the values arrived).  :class:`CancellableReads` runs each as
one asyncio task, named by a read id.
